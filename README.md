# Plug.dj Browserscript Collection


This is a collection of scripts I made for everyday use on plug.dj. They are just small utilities but already help out a lot.
You can use these files by running
```
javascript:(function(){$.getScript("https://flybel.de/xxxxxx.js");}());
```
as a bookmark or
```
$.getScript("https://flybel.de/xxxxxx.js");
```
in the developer console. Replace xxxxxx by the file you want to run, all of these files are available on flybel.de under the same name.
